## 🔧 If You Need Help

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**: Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Usually auto-resolves with Docker setup

### Issue: App doesn't start
**Solution**: Render should auto-detect PORT
- Your `render.yaml` already configures this

### Issue: WebSocket not working
**Solution**: Render supports WebSockets by default
- Your Spring Boot WebSocket should work perfectly
